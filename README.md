## fun facts
- i am decaying from lack of a good website hosting place
- there being no apostrophe in my username (outside of the profile and stuff) angers me to no end
- i am trying to make a long form project i can have fun with and be proud of
- i really have to learn new skills
- if you're peeping you likely aren't supposed to be here with a few exceptions so GET OUT!!!
